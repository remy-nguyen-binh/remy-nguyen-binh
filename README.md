# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Remy Nguyen 
I'm a data-loving bilingual wizard fluent in English, French, and Python, turning messy data into dazzling insights while juggling algorithms like a circus pro; if Iâ€™m not predicting coffee sales or decoding real estate, Iâ€™m probably failing to forecast my own career trajectory â€“ and yes, I do ring muscle-ups in my free time!
